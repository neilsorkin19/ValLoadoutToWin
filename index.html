<h2>Valorant Win Probability Calculator - CMSC320 Final Project</h2>
<h4>Created by <a href="https://www.neilsorkin.com/">Neil Sorkin</a> - Undergraduate Student at the University of
    Maryland in <a
            href="https://cmsc320.github.io/">CMSC320 (Introduction to Data Science)</a></h4>

    Calculate
</button>

<p>Currently, the calculation outputs out a random number, but in the real version of the app, I will use Tensorflow to
    train a model for the real expected win probabilities, and use this model's inference to generate the
    probabilities.</p>
<p>
    The dimensionality of this problem is very high, so I will probably need hundreds of thousands of games to train an
    accurate model. Additionally, I need to be able to retrain the data when there is a new patch as the guns and agents
    can change. So, I need persistent access to the Valorant API.
</p>
<p>
    In the future, I may add other variables, like ultimate points / status, ability purchases, the ability to input KDA
    in the match for each player (an 0/20/0 Jett is not going to change the outcome very much with their Bladestorm), and
    ping. As this calculator stands, it is more useful from an esports caster point of view where you know the loadouts
    of both teams and can numerically evaluate the "smartness" of a buy. To a player in the game, you don't know a lot
    of the information required, but perhaps I could make the calculator guess what the
    enemy team will buy based on their bank and how optimal each loadout is for that team.
