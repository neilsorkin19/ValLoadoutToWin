<h2>Valorant Win Probability Calculator - CMSC320 Final Project</h2>
<h4>Created by <a href="https://www.neilsorkin.com/">Neil Sorkin</a> - Undergraduate Student at the University of
    Maryland in <a
            href="https://cmsc320.github.io/">CMSC320 (Introduction to Data Science)</a></h4>
<select id="select_map">
    <option value="none" selected disabled hidden>Select a map...</option>
</select>

<table id="loadouts">
</table>

<button id="calculate" onclick="calculate()">
    Calculate
</button>

<p>Currently, the calculation outputs out a random number, but in the real version of the app, I will use Tensorflow to
    perform inference using a model I trained with a 9GB dataset of Radiant / Immortal games. During March 2022, I
    trained this deep learning model to predict the round outcome with 61.7% accuracy before it
    starts.</p>

<p>
    In the future, I may add the ability to load preset matches. This way, you don't have to type in each box. I might
    also add a way to save presets so you can experiment with loadouts.
