# Valorant - A Data Science Approach
In this project, I calculate the round win and match win probabilities for every round. We also calculate the favorable positions of players with kill-death heatmaps.
The generation and interpretation of these plots is explained in the [website](https://neilsorkin19.github.io/ValLoadoutToWin/).
The mockup of the round win and match win calculator can be found [here](https://neilsorkin19.github.io/ValLoadoutToWin/calculator/).
